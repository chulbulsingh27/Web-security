# Web-security
My research interests focuses on computer security and networks and can be grouped into the following, partially overlapping areas:

1. Web security focusing on the detection of malware on websites, and the identification of the mechanisms  deployed by hackers and spammers.

2. Network science, complex systems and social networks, where the goal is to model the topology, understand the evolution, identify patterns, and detect anomalies, including physical network topologies, communication interaction, biological networks, and human-centric networks .

3. Network security and measurements focusing on classifying traffic and detecting malware and intrusions  in enterprise and backbone networks.

4. Network protocols focusing on improving the performance of protocols in the areas of: Internet routing (BGP), robust and scalable ad hoc routing, contend distribution, privacy and anonymity, and group communications.

1.1  Web security: fighting cyber-crime
Web security is a more interesting  area of research for me , which attracted me because of the dire need for protecting both websites and web-surfers. The urgency and its immediate practical impact have increased, since the web seems to have become the vector of choice for virus propagation.

Scope and importance: Every day, 6000 websites are blacklisted (as dangerous) by Google. Websites have become the new battleground of cyber-terrorism and cyber-crime. Web-based crime hurts the reputation and revenue of ecommerce sites, turns websites into distributors of malware, compromises sensitive company and customer data, and threatens national security. An estimated 70-90% of the 199 million active websites are vulnerable, including highly-visible sites. Being professionally hosted is not a solution either: large hosting companies have tens of thousands of 
compromised sites. Trends suggest that website protection is where PC anti-virus protection was in
1999: what started as an optional luxury, has become an absolute necessity.

1.2 Network science, complex systems and social networks

Scope and importance: The overarching goal is to understand how large complex systems behave and evolve, which includes methods to model the topology, understand the evolution, identify patterns, and detect anomalies. Another interesting and related question is to understand and model fundamental propagation properties of a network, such as transition phenomena.

1.3 Network security and traffic modeling
Within the large area of network security, we have focused on measuring, modeling, and classifying traffic, and using this knowledge and tools to detect malware and intrusions.

Scope and importance: Monitoring the traffic and detecting unwanted applications is far from trivial. The authors of controversial applications often obfuscate their traffic to make them very hard to detect by using encryption or ever-changing behavior. Thus, we want an approach that has the following properties: (a) it is easy to use in practice and for a wide range of tasks, and (b) it can operate with limited, partial or erroneous information.

1.4 Network protocols: robustness, scalability, and efficiency
This broadly-defined area includes a large number of multi-year efforts.
This area includes efforts that attempt to: (a) measure and model how various network protocols work, and (b) design more efficient protocols.

Conclusion and Future Plans: 
Computer security is a dynamic and fast growing field. My interest in web security is motivated by its importance and urgency, which will only increase in the future. The are two main reasons for this observed trend. First, hackers from all over the world are constantly finding new and ingenuous ways to attack. At the same time, web technology is becoming more complex, interactive,
and more accessible, which means that non-technical people can launch their own website in a matter of minutes. My intent is to play a role in making the web a safer place. This will require several things: (a) keeping abreast of the novel techniques hackers use, (b) pulling resources together from diverse technical fields, (c) leveraging the power of community efforts and user participation, and (d) leading efforts to develop standards, best practices and educate users and technologists.
Looking forward working under guidance of amazing Professors at IIT Roorkee.
